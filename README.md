# Responsiveness-Portfolio


Created a portfolio website that included three pages, index.html that discussed about me, contact.html with a form to submit contact information and portfolio.html that lists placeholder images to future websites that will be created.
I made the navigation bar consistent across all three pages that collapses when the page size is reduced.
I made a footer that was consistent across all three pages.
I also created a main body section that holds the main page information. 
When the page size is adjusted from large to small the images and layout are responsive.
Bootstrapcdn.com was linked to all pages and bootstrap components, features and classes where used when building this website. 
I also linked google fonts as well as a style.css.
